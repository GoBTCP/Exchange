- Bugs are always worked before enhancements
- We pay **bounties** for issues that have been estimated. An estimated issue is prefixed with a number in brackets like this: `[7] An nasty bug`. In this example, the bug is valued at 7 BTCP. If you fix this issue according to these guidelines and your PR is accepted, this will earn you 7 BTCP. You must have a BTCP wallet to receive payment.
- If an issue is already claimed (assigned), you can ask the dev if they would like assistance for a portion of the bounty. 
- To claim an issue, simply leave a comment with your request to claim in the Github issue.
- If you believe an issue should be fixed, please leave details about it in the *Issues Tab*
